In this early stage of the webapp, it may be that the 
translator has some difficulty with many-worded slang
expressions, or with the kinds of truncated inflections 
that are sometimes seen in the spoken langauge (such as
"kirjastos" instead of "kirjastossa"). In order to get the
best results, you may want to rewrite the many-worded
expressions in their baseform, and do the same for
those with truncated inflections - or replace those
with the full inflectional forms of the booklanguage.
