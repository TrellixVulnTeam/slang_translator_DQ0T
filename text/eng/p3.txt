For the time being, this translator only translates Slang for the Finnish language.
However, I would like to add multiple langauges to this app. If you know of a language 
that you would like to be added, and you think you have the resources to help, send 
an email to takaisin140116@gmail.com. Or if you have any other comments or questions, please
direct them to that email.
