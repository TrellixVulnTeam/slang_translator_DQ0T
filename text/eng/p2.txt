All of the definitions here are taken from the Finnish Urban dictionary,
the link to which is here : <a> urbaanisanakirja.com </a> These definitions are 
provided by private individuals who have made themselves part of that commmunity.
For that reason, some definitions may be more or less accurate - so a plus / minus 
rating is provided next to each translation, and an option to cycle through different 
definitions is provided, if multiple translations were suggested. Due to the sourcing 
of the definitions, if a slang word isn't on that website, it won't be translated by the app.
